# Fundamentals of Data Science
This repositery contains code for the assignments of the Fundamentals of Data Science course for which I received the grade of 8.0/10.0.

Assignment 1 performs sentiment analysis of tweets.

Assignment 2 assesses the nature of the relationship between user Instagram activity and the content of the images and their well-being. This was done with data on the user, images and their metadata and features extracted from the images (e.g. sentiment, faces).
